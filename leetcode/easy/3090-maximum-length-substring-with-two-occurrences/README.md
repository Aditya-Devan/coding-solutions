![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string `s`, return the  **maximum**  length of a substring such that it contains  *at most two occurrences*  of each character.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  s = "bcbbbcba"

 **Output:**  4

 **Explanation:** 

The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: `"bcbbbcba"`.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  s = "aaaa"

 **Output:**  2

 **Explanation:** 

The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: `"aaaa"`.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= s.length <= 100
- s consists only of lowercase English letters.

        int left = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            int ch = s.charAt(right) - 'a';
            count[ch]++;
            while (count[ch] > 2) {
                int ch2 = s.charAt(left) - 'a';
                count[ch2]--;
                left++;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, right - left + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
