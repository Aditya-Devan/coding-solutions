# Trapping Rain Water

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
- 0 <= height[i] <= 105

```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {

        int n = height.length;
        int totalWater = 0;

        int leftMax = 0;
        int rightMax = 0;

        int start = 0;
        int end = n - 1;

        while (start < end) {

            leftMax = Math.max(leftMax, height[start]);
            rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, height[end]);

            if (leftMax < rightMax) {

                totalWater += leftMax - height[start];
                start++;

            } else {

                totalWater += rightMax - height[end];
                end--;
            }
        }

        return totalWater;
    }
}
```
